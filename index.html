results text: you should get a '$colour' '$breed'! '$breed' cats are '$cuteness' and '$independent' creatures. they are '$breedsize' and '$hideability'. your particular '$breed' will be a'$pattern' with '$texture/$hairyness'. your cat will 'come from a shelter/come from a petshop/show up in your back garden and adopt you/be your personal little rescue'. your new cat is '$wild'.
e.g: you should get a cream and white munchkin! munchkin cats are sweet and self-reliant creatures. they are small and easy to hide. your particular munchkin will be a two-tone cat with short hair. your cat will show up in your back garden and adopt you. your new cat is an escaped housecat.    -->
