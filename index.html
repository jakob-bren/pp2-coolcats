breed= mainecoon, munchkin, tuxedo, tabby, sphynx, siamese
colour= bw, white, black, brown, silver, red, cream, coffee

questions e.g "do you enjoy vacuuming" "would you have to hide your cat from your landlord" "which of the three patterns appeals to you most" 
"which cat is most appealing to you/what does your house look like" "adopt or be adopted" "are cats commodities?" "do you like divas?"

results text: you should get a '$colour' '$breed'! '$breed' cats are '$cuteness' and '$independent' creatures. they are '$breedsize' and '$hideability'. your particular '$breed' will be a'$pattern' with '$texture/$hairyness'. your cat will 'come from a shelter/come from a petshop/show up in your back garden and adopt you/be your personal little rescue'. your new cat is '$wild'.
e.g: you should get a cream and white munchkin! munchkin cats are sweet and self-reliant creatures. they are small and easy to hide. your particular munchkin will be a two-tone cat with short hair. your cat will show up in your back garden and adopt you. your new cat is an escaped housecat.    -->
